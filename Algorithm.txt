ðŸ”¹ Algorithm: Multi-threaded Unique Number Extractor
Input

A text file containing one integer per line.

Initialization

Create a thread-safe global data structure (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet() in Java) to store unique numbers.

Read File

Read all the integers from the input file and store them in a list.

Divide Work

Choose the number of threads (e.g., 4).

Divide the list into equal chunks (sub-lists), one for each thread.

Thread Processing

For each chunk, create a thread:

Each thread goes through its assigned sublist.

Each number is added to the global unique set.

Wait for Threads to Finish

Join all threads (i.e., wait for all threads to complete execution).

Output

Print the final list of unique numbers from the global set (sorted if needed).
